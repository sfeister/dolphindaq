Keyword	Gettable	Settable	Is Array	Data type	Description
*IDN	1	0	0	string	Identification of device
TRIGger:COUNt	1	1	0	uint64	Global external trigger count (whether or not an acquisition occurred)
TRIGger:DECimation	1	1	0	uint32	"Optionally, acquire data only on every other trigger (=2), every fifth trigger (=5), or every tenth trigger(=10), etc. Default is to attempt acquisition on every single trigger. (default=1)."
SYSTem:TIME	1	0	0	string	"System time (UTC time zone) in YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS format, where HH is 24-hour format."
SYSTem:TIME:UNIX	1	1	0	int64	"System time in Unix Time. (Int64, UTC, seconds since Jan 1, 1970)"
MCU:TEMPerature	1	0	0	double	Chip temperature in degrees C
DIODe:TRACe:DECimation	1	1	0	uint32	"Further decimation on top of the trigger decimation, that only affects the rate of buffering and transmitting full traces. (This number does not affect the rate of creating metrics.) For example, if TRIGger:DECimation = 3 and DIODe:TRACe:DECimation = 50, only one of every 150 external trigger events will result in a full trace being buffered for transmission."
DIODe:TRACe:DT	1	0	0	double	"Delta-time for Trace, in seconds"
DIODe:TRACe:NT	1	0	0	double	Number of elements in a single trace
DIODe:TRACe:YMIN	1	0	0	double	"Minimum value, in Volts, corresponding to raw ADC value of 0"
DIODe:TRACe:YMAX	1	0	0	double	"Minimum value, in Volts, corresponding to raw ADC value of 2^16 - 1"
DIODe:TRACe:YARRay	1	0	1	Array of uint16	"Y-value array (as UINT16 raw adc values), formatted a comma-separated ASCII values list. Number of elements in array is DIODe:TRACe:NT."
DIODe:METRics:SIZE	1	0	0	uint32	Number of shots accumulated per single batch of transmitted metrics
DIODe:METRics:BACKground:MEAn	1	0	1	Array of double	"Mean of T2 interval (background interval), in Volts. Formatted a comma-separated ASCII values list. Number of elements in array is DIODe:METRics:SIZE."
DIODe:METRics:REDuced:INTegral	1	0	1	Array of double	"Reduced signal integration (Integral of [signal - mean background]), in Volts * seconds. Formatted a comma-separated ASCII values list. Number of elements in array is DIODe:METRics:SIZE."
DIODe:METRics:REDuced:MAX	1	0	1	Array of double	"Reduced signal maximum, in Volts (max signal - mean background). Formatted a comma-separated ASCII values list. Number of elements in array is DIODe:METRics:SIZE."

DIODe:DT	1	1	0	double	"Delta-time for data acquisition (ADC), in seconds. Currently equivalent to MEAS:TRACE:DT."
DIODe:T1:VALue	1	1	0	double	Time interval (in seconds) between the external trigger input and the ADC start.
DIODe:T2:VALue	1	1	0	double	Time interval (in seconds) for the background acquisition. Part of the ADC trace.
DIODe:T2:NT	1	0	0	uint32	Number of DIODe:DT steps represented by T2. Useful in masking the acquisition segments of the ADC trace.
DIODe:T3:VALue	1	1	0	double	"Time interval (in seconds) for ""dead time"" between background acquisition and signal acquisition. Part of the ADC trace."
